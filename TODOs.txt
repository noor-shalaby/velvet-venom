        a Zombie has 3 body parts: Body, ArmLeft and ArmRight, each with its own separate hp
        hitting the Body damages the main hp directly, which results in a Zombie's death on reaching 0
        hitting either of the arms would mainly damage that specific arm's hp, but also contribute to the damage of the main hp but not as much as direct Body hits would
        on reaching 0 on the hp of an arm, the arm would be torn off the body and dropping its sprite permanently on the ground in an animation
        losing an arm would result in the Zombie losing half of its damage
